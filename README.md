# ClassicComputerScienceProblemsInPython
problems from "Classic Computer Science Problems In Python" book, potencially with some personal notes and exercise solutions (which are only suggestioned after each chapter). I'll keep only the final version of each problem, since in the original book he maintains multiple files to build logic until the full solution is made.
